This Dependabot PR safely updates Go dependencies:
- `golang.org/x/crypto` v0.42.0 → v0.45.0 (security fixes included)
- `golang.org/x/mod` v0.28.0 → v0.29.0 (minor improvements)
- `golang.org/x/net` v0.43.0 → v0.47.0 (security fixes included)  
- `golang.org/x/sync` v0.17.0 → v0.18.0 (minor improvements)
- `golang.org/x/sys` v0.36.0 → v0.38.0 (minor improvements)
- `golang.org/x/text` v0.29.0 → v0.31.0 (minor improvements)
- `golang.org/x/tools` v0.36.0 → v0.38.0 (minor improvements)
- `github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2` v2.2.1 → v2.4.0 (feature updates)

All updates are minor version bumps with backward compatibility. `mapstructure` is marked as `// indirect` (transitive dependency), so changes won't affect the codebase directly. Standard library updates include important security patches.
